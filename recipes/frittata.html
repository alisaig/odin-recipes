    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Frittata is always my go-to dish when I feel like having a vegetarian day. It requires no crazy or fancy ingredients and can be easily made with things you probably already have lying around in your kitchen anyway. The main ingredient that stays constant in all frittatas is the eggs. Once you have that, you can add anything else that you like, such as different combinations of vegetables, meats and cheeses. However, you must of course be careful to not overfill it to the point it becomes too mushy and falls apart.</p>
    <p>My favorite way to make this egg recipe is to add potatoes, onions, mushrooms and either parmiggiano reggiano or a soft goat cheese. This variation is most appropriate for the fall as the ingredients are quite filling and its of course mushroom season. When it comes to mushrooms, I suggest using whatever types are local to your area. In my case, I usually use button, portobello, cremini, porcini or a combination of these mushrooms. Cheese-wise in this recipe I will be using chevre, as I like something soft and mild in my frittata, but you could also grate an aged cheese like parmiggiano reggiano or pecorino romano.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Recipe makes one large frittata, serves 2-3</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium Eggs</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> large Onion</li>
        <li>2-3 medium Mushrooms</li>
        <li>3 medium Potatoes</li>
        <li>150g Goat cheese</li>
        <li>2tbsp Olive oil</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add half the olive oil to a pan on medium heat. Cut the onion into thin strips and add it to the pan. Salt the onions and every following new ingredient, to your preference, as you go.</li>
        <li>Cut each potato in half and then cut each half into thin half moon slices and add them to the pan with the onions.</li>
        <li>Cut the mushrooms into thin slices. Once the onions and potatoes are half-cooked through, which should take around 5-7 minutes, also add the mushrooms to the pan and turn the heat to medium high so the mushrooms release their liquids and can brown a little. Sprinkle some black pepper in the pan to your liking.</li>
        <li>Once the mushrooms are cooked through after around 5 minutes, take all the vegetables out of the pan and onto a plate to allow them to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>As you wait for the vegetables to cool, crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season them with salt, pepper and some cayenne if you'd like. Beat the eggs with a fork or whisk.</li>
        <li>Once the vegetables have cooled, combine them in the bowl with the eggs. Ideally you should now wait 15 minutes for the mixture to better mix and absorb, but if you're short on time you can start cooking it straight away. Add the remaining olive oil to a pan on medium heat and then also add the mixture.</li>
        <li>Crumble the goat cheese into small chunks and add them to the top of the frittata while it's still mostly raw. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius to heat up.</li>
        <li>After 10 minutes, carefully lift the frittata off the pan with a spatula and place it on a baking tray lined with a baking paper. Put it in the oven and cook it for another 10 minutes until it is evenly cooked through.</li>
        <li>Plate the frittata, cut into slices like you would a pizza, and enjoy!</li>
