    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe dear to me as it's something I learned to make from my mother and often made together with her. I've always loved making it in the fall or winter when it's cold out and I need something hearty to warm me up. It also makes no use of animal products, so it's a great option if you're vegan!</p>
    <p>Don't feel like you have to follow the amounts for the water and coconut milk too strictly, as you might need to use more or less depending on how thick your coconut milk is or how much of your water evaporates when you're cooking. Adjust according to how thick you want the consistency and how intense you want the coconut taste to be. Same thing for the chili, feel free to add more if you want the soup to be spicier. If you happen to add too much, add more coconut milk to make it more mellow!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Recipe serves 4</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 large Onion</li>
        <li>1 large Carrot</li>
        <li>1 stalk of Celery</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>10g Ginger</li>
        <li>4 medium Potatoes</li>
        <li>1 small Pumpkin</li>
        <li>1/2 Red Chili Pepper</li>
        <li>2 Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>1/2tsp Coriander Seeds</li>
        <li>1/2tsp Turmeric</li>
        <li>1.75l Water</li>
        <li>150ml Coconut Milk</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the onion into thick strips, the carrot into thick diagonal slices and the celery into thirds. Add everything to a cooking pot with an oil of your choice on medium high heat. Lightly salt to help the vegetables sweat.</li>
        <li>Split the garlic cloves in half and cut the piece of ginger into diagonal slices. Add them to the pot with the rest of the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Once the vegetables have started to brown on the bottom, deglaze by adding the water and turn up the heat to bring the water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Grind the coriander seeds into a powder (or use ground coriander if you don't have whole seeds) and add it to the pot with the bay leaves and turmeric.</li>
        <li>Roughly cut the potatoes and pumpkin into small chunks and add them to the pot. Add the black pepper and a little more salt, and leave everything to cook for 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk and leave everything to cook another 5 minutes or until the potatoes and pumpkin have sufficiently softened.</li>
        <li>Take the cooking pot off the heat and remove the bay leaves. <strong>This step is very important as leaving it on a heated stove could cause the soup to splash and burn you when blending it!</strong> 
        <li>Cut the red chili pepper into small slices and remove the seeds if you prefer. Add them to the pot.</li>
        <li>Use a stick (immersion) blender to blend everything into a perfectly creamy consistency. If at this point you find the consistency too dense, add a little bit of water. Also have a taste of the soup and add more salt if you find it necessary.</li>
        <li>Put the pot back on the stove and leave the soup to cook another 5 minutes on a low heat.</li>
        <li>Serve and add a sprinkle of pumpkin seeds on top. Enjoy!</li>
